# Sustainable-Development-Goal

🌍 SDG Visualization Project for India

This project visualizes Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) across India using geospatial data. The project integrates geographic data with SDG data and presents it through an interactive web application.

🗺️ Data Collection
Shapefiles: Acquired from the [Survey of India](https://surveyofindia.gov.in/).
SDG Data: Collected from the [NITI Aayog](https://www.niti.gov.in/) website.

🔗 Data Integration in QGIS
Shapefile and SDG Dataset: Loaded into [QGIS](https://qgis.org/).
Data Integration: Used the join function in QGIS to combine the geographic data with the SDG dataset.

🌍 Layer Development
Thematic Layers: Developed 5 thematic layers, each corresponding to a different SDG goal.
Accuracy: Ensured each layer accurately represents its respective SDG.

🌐 Publishing via GeoServer
Uploading: Uploaded the thematic layers to [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/).
Styling: Defined and applied appropriate styles to each layer using SLD (Styled Layer Descriptor).
Preview: Previewed the styled layers in GeoServer to ensure they are displayed correctly.

💻 Web Application Development
Frontend Development: Designed and implemented the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Interactive Features: Integrated interactive features that allow users to dynamically display and interact with the layers.

🌟 User Experience Enhancement
Optimization: Focused on optimizing the application for a user-friendly experience.
Navigation: Improved navigation to ensure the application is intuitive and easy to use.
